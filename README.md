This tool is still WIP.

### What works
- Rendering a Lexer definition
- Evaluating Lexer definitions
- A "Language-Tester" window that lets you play with your Lexer definitions.

### What doesn't work (TODO)
- editing Lexer definitions
- exporting/importing to/from a file
- exporting for use with other tools like Antlr or CodeMirror
- polishing the UX in general...
- ... and much more
